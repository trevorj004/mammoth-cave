Welcome to the Jensen Family Reunion 2017 Mammoth Cave official webpage. Throughout this webpage you will find information about food, directions, activities, and other parts of his trip. This page will be used as an anouncements page for updates. Scroll down to see recent updates.

<i class="fa fa-globe fa-lg"></i>
<p> "The summer schedule is now available for Mammoth Cave tours so it is time to book our tours. Tours can sell out. So, if we are wanting to all do the same tours, now is the time to book them.

We are recommending that we do the Historic Tour at 10:00. This tour is 2 hours and covers 2 miles. There are 120 steps over the course of the tour and it rated a moderate difficulty level. We did this tour when we visited 3 summers ago (so our kids were 7 and 9). We had no difficulty on this tour and there were younger kids there as well. Tour costs $14 for adults (13 and up), $9 for kids (6-12), kids under 6 are free. This tour takes you through most of the popular areas, “fat man’s misery”, “tall man’s misery”, “bottomless pit”, and the huge “Broadway” and the “Rotunda”. They do turn off all of the lights during this tour so you can see true darkness. Most of the tour is in large areas, but there are some tight areas that are not recommended if you are claustrophobic. They take 120 on this tour, but last time I checked there were only 100 slots left. That’s obviously plenty for us, but other people are already booking, so we need to act soon.

We are also recommending that we do the Domes and Dripstones Tour at 2:00 in the afternoon. This tour is 2 hours, but only ¾ miles. It is also rated moderate difficulty level. There are 500 steps over the course of the tour (I believe that 100 might be optional). Tour costs $15 for adults, $10 for kids. We did not do this tour, but did the Frozen Niagara which I will explain next. This tour covers the entire Frozen Niagara Tour, but adds an extra ½ mile. The Historic and Domes and Dripstones are the tours that they recommend for first time visitors as they allow you to see the most popular areas of the cave. This tour takes 118 people and is already filling up as well.

An alternate option is the Frozen Niagara Tour. There is a tour at 2:30 which is at a similar time to the Domes and Dripstones. There are 100 optional steps. I would recommend this for younger children, especially if you did the morning tour and you’re not sure if they would be up for another moderate tour. This is rated as Easy. It is ¼ mile and lasts 1 ¼ hours. It costs $13 for adults and $9 for kids. They only take 39 people on this tour and I think there were only 20 slots left when I looked this week. We could not all do this tour together, so I would recommend the Domes and Dripstones for those families with older kids.

There are more difficult tours if you are wanting a more intense caving experience. But we are hoping that the majority of people will do the Historic and Domes and Dripstones so we can experience the tours together.

Other info: there are no strollers or child backpack carriers allowed in the caves. They keep the pace moving reasonably quickly and then stop at key areas to talk about things and allow you to take pictures (no flash or tripods). Be aware that there are tight areas on these tours.

We felt that one tour in the morning and one in the afternoon felt ideal. We can eat our packed lunches in between the tours. There is also a Junior Ranger Nature Track at 1:00 that lasts for about a half hour that kids could do and would still be able to make it to the 2:00 tour. There is also a porch talk at the visitor’s center that the rangers do at 1:15 that lasts 15 minutes. There is also a Visitor’s Center that is fun to explore.

Please let us know your thoughts about these plans. We are planning to book the tours for our family this week, but wanted to get a little feedback before we booked. https://www.nps.gov/maca/planyourvisit/summer-schedule.htm"</p>


<i class="fa fa-calendar fa-lg"></i>
<p>"I know that people have been talking about the family reunion so I thought that I should post some updates. 

Dates are July 5-8.
Check in starts at 3:00. We will plan to arrive at 3:00. We are planning to take care of all of the meals. Because there really aren’t a lot of stores around town, we figure that it will be difficult for people to be in charge of meals, so we will plan to bring all of the food down with us.

We will have dinner for Wednesday night for anyone that is already there by dinner time. Since some people are driving and some are flying, we are not sure when everyone will be arriving. There will be no official plans that night. There are a lot of activities always going on at the campground. We don’t know the exact schedule yet since it is too far out, but there are 2 pools, a splash pad, playgrounds, a jumping pillow, volleyball, basketball,etc. Plus they seem to have daily events during the summer like movie nights, karaoke events, crafts, contests, etc. http://jellystonemammothcave.com/

Thursday we will have breakfast at the campground. Then we will go to Mammoth Cave for the day. They also do not have the summer schedule listed yet, but when they do, we will want to make advanced reservations. We are currently planning to take the Domes and Dripstones tour and the Historic Tour. But we have to wait to see the details and times for these tours. They both have quite a few stairs and are 2 hours each. Between the 2 tours, you would get a great overview of the caves. They include the frozen niagara section, fat man’s misery and the rotunda. If that is too much, you could just choose one tour or the other, or do the Frozen Niagara tour instead of the Domes and Dripstones which is shorter. We figured that we would do one tour in the morning, then eat a packed lunch and walk around in the visitor’s center. Then do a second tour in the afternoon. You can’t bring strollers, or child backpack carriers into the caves. They also don’t allow flash photography. It is very cool in the caves and you will want to bring pants and a sweatshirt or jacket. https://www.nps.gov/maca/index.htm

This is all subject to change when the tours and times get posted for the summer.



After the afternoon tour, we plan to go back and spend time at the campground for the rest of the day. We will do dinner there.



The next day, we will have breakfast at the campground. Then we are spending the day at Kentucky Action Park. An all day pass is $25 for over 6 year olds (5 and under are free). It is open 10-6. The pass includes: alpine slide, go carts, bumper cars, trampoline, climbing wall, bumper boats, mini golf and outlaw cave tour. There is also horse back riding and zip lining for an additional price. There is food sold there (hot dogs, nachos, etc). You can pack sandwich stuff left over from the day before or just plan to buy lunch there. If you don’t want to spend the day at Kentucky Action park, you can stay at the campground and swim and do activities there.
We will have dinner at the campground again.
The next day, we will have breakfast at the campground. Then check out is 11:00
.
Our meal thoughts so far are:
Wed Dinner: Nacho Bar – chips, taco meat, cheese, etc, brownie bites for dessert
Thurs Breakfast: bagels, cream cheese, jam, fruit
Lunch: Packed peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, chips, carrots, fruit and cookies
Dinner: Pulled Pork Sandwiches, salad,watermelon, and ice cream sandwiches
Friday Breakfast: Breakfast burritos, yogurt
Lunch: Kentucky Action Park (Or sandwiches)
Dinner: Baked Potato Bar – potatoes, chili, broccoli, cheese, sour cream, and other toppings, roast marshmallows for dessert
Saturday Breakfast: Cereal and fruit



We will bring a lot of the food precooked and ready to reheat. We will need to use some people’s refrigerators and ovens to help store and prepare food. Let me know if any of this seems like it will not work for your family. Again food is subject to change depending on cost and how practical it is as I continue thinking things through.



As far as we know, everyone is all set on their reservations and we have several cabins in a row.



I found a place here in Cincinnati that will accept lightly used linens that they are using for helping refugees. I heard that some people were considering buying linens when you arrive and then donating them. I can definitely help with that if that is what you choose to do.

This is all that I can think of for now. Please let me know if you have any questions. We’ll post more specific info as it gets closer, but I know that people have been working on making travel arrangements so I wanted to provide as much info as possible."</p>
<i class="fa fa-road fa-lg"></i>

<p>"As it is getting closer to the time when we will need to book our Mammoth Cave lodging, I figured that I would get some more info from everyone. The campsite is set up in a way that the different campsite and cabin styles are all intermixed. I think that it would be nice if we all are nearby each other. So I am hoping that everyone can look at the list of cabin/campsite types in the next week or so. If you can decide which type of cabin/campsite you would like (or preferably give a few options - since several have similar prices), I will then figure out on the map the best specific campsites/cabins numbers that should allow us to be close together.

Here is the list of prices:
http://jellystonemammothcave.com/camping/reservations-rates/

Here are cabin descriptions:
http://jellystonemammothcave.com/camping/cabins/

Here are campsite descriptions:
http://jellystonemammothcave.com/camping/campsites/

All reservations can be cancelled with a 7 day notice less a $15 fee, so it really seems the best to book as soon as possible to ensure that we get the spaces that we want.

Some additional info that I got when I called them:
The bear dens are listed as sleeping 8, but really can sleep 10, but there is not a private bath. The Amish cabin can sleep up to 10, but does not have 10 separate beds. It is the biggest cabin for the $. The Primitive campsites are the cheapest, but they are not very close to the bathrooms.

Please let me know what specific type of cabin/campsite you are thinking of when you have a chance.

    <p> "I know it seems early, but I have been thinking a lot about the 2017 family reunion. I wanted to share some info that I have found and find out what everyone's thoughts are. Basically, I don't want to keep spending time trying to plan a trip if it is not going to be feasible for people to come.

We had talked about holding the reunion near Mammoth Cave, Kentucky. We have been there and it is an amazing experience to tour the caves. Unfortunately, it is in a tiny little Kentucky town with not much around it. This makes things difficult for lodging, food, etc. I'm concerned that it may prove to be too expensive.

Here is what I have found so far. The best (pretty much only feasible) place for us to stay, is Jellystone Park http://jellystonemammothcave.com/ It seems like an amazing place to stay.

The many positives are: there are lots of cabins and tent sites. It could definitely accommodate us size wise. The cabins all have full kitchens and fire rings which would help with meal preparation. Jellystone has lots of activities included when you stay there: 2 pools, a water slide, a jumping pillow, splash pad, mini golf, and various daily activities like crafts, karaoke, etc. It is close to Mammoth Cave and has a lot of space for us to gather and do family activities.

The negatives are that it is fairly expensive: Cabins range from $145-$265 per night. There are some ways that families could try to share a cabin to make it less expensive, or the bear den sleeps 10-12 for only $120 but those don't have a private bathroom. There are tent sites if people wanted to camp to save money, but we know that it is very difficult to camp if you are flying. Another negative is that they do not provide towels and sheets for the cabins (they do provide pillows). Again, if you are flying, it would not seem easy to bring your linens with you and while we have extra sheets and towels, we don't have enough for everyone. Another negative is that we would have to book a year out. Anywhere that we would stay near mammoth cave would require this timeline. There just aren't that many places to stay and July is their busiest month. This would mean that we would need people to commit this year, long before your girls/scout camps dates are out for 2017.

I assume that if people made the effort to come all of the way out here, we would want to stay there 3 nights. Mammoth Cave tours really will only take one day and will cost appox. $13 per person. I was thinking that we would do 2 tours.

The only other really fun thing to do in the area is going to Kentucky Action Park. http://www.kentuckyactionpark.com/ They have an alpine slide, trampoline, bumper boats, etc. But this place is $25 a person for unlimited access for the whole day.

It's possible that we could fill enough time with just the cave tours and activities at Jellystone park, but they don't have the activities listed this far in advance at Jellystone and I think that would give us a lot of down time.

I have tried looking for more places to stay, but it is very difficult to find anywhere that will accommodate large family sizes.

Basically, what I am hoping to find out from you is:

If we have a reunion on this side of the country, would you be willing to come?
Does Mammoth Cave sound like a place that you would be interested to go to?
Do you think that you would fly or drive?
Would you want to camp or stay in a cabin?
Would it be possibly to choose dates this summer for next year to ensure that we could get reservations?
Do you have any other thoughts on Jellystone/Mammoth Cave/Kentucky Action Park?

I want to make sure that this is a vacation that people are interested in and that it is financially possible before I spend any more time working on it."</p><!-- Content Ends HERE -->
